CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gcc</TT
> comes with a code coverage tool called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gcov</TT
>.
The output from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gcov</TT
> is a plain text file: detailed but dry. This project
uses the output from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gcov</TT
> to colourize the original source code (in
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>html</TT
>) which allows the user to more quickly determine which
parts of the code are run, relatively, more or less often than others.
 </P

>It can certainly be educational to instrument your application with coverage
analysis enabled and run it in a deployed environment to see (under real scenarios)
which lines of code are not reached, and how frequently each reached line of code is executed.
However, in a deployed situation you're probably more interested in performance
analysis (as opposed to simply coverage analysis) so the tool to use would be
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gprof</TT
>. Coverage information is very valuable, though, while
performing tests since the generated data allows you to determine
how much of your application code is being tested (or, conversely, which code
paths are not being tested).
 </P
><P
>You can use this tool as part of your regular build system to generate the colourized
coverage analysis when running your tests.
If your build uses the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>autotools</TT
> and makes use of the "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make check</TT
>"
target, you can easily encorporate this <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gcov2html-check</TT
> tool to provide
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>html</TT
> files of your source code showing unit and/or integration test coverage
automatically.
 </P
><P
>If your application code is in C there is a unit test helper tool called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Check</TT
>.
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gcov2html-check</TT
> also provides support for converting the XML output from the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Check</TT
> tool
into test results (in addition to the source code coverage colourization).
